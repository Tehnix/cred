cred (Connected Reactive Electronic Devices), enables you to connect your
electronic devices, in a way so that they can communicate with each other
and react on events happening in the network. 

Events can for example be one device turning on, which then sends out a 
signal (an event). Others are then able to subscribe to different events, 
and can react when they are notified that such an event has occured.


Usage
=====

First, get a server running. Then connect each device to the server, while
also registrering what events they react to, and what they are capable of
themselves.
